      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was born on May 29, 1970, in Manhattan, New York to Howard Stark, a famous genius
        inventor and businessman, and Maria Stark, a socialite and philanthropist. Growing up under the eye of family
        butler Edwin Jarvis, his life was characterized by a cold and affectionless relationship with his father. Seeing
        that his son could achieve great things, Howard tried to inspire him with constant talks about his own role in
        the
        creation of Captain America. This instead embittered Stark, who felt that his father was taking more pride in
        his
        creations than in his family. A brilliant and unique child prodigy, Stark attended MIT for two years starting at
        age 14, and graduated summa cum laude at 17. On December 16, 1991, when Stark was 21, his parents went away to
        the
        Bahamas, but planned to stop at the Pentagon to deliver Super Soldier Serum Howard had redeveloped. Instead,
        both
        are killed in a car accident—later revealed to be an assassination carried out by the Winter Soldier, who was
        mind-controlled by Hydra to steal the serum.[a] As a result, Stark inherited his father's company, becoming CEO
        of
        Stark Industries. Over the years, he became well known as a weapons designer and inventor, and lived a playboy
        lifestyle. At a New Year's Eve party for the new millennium, he attended a conference in Bern where he met
        scientists Maya Hansen, inventor of the Extremis experimental regenerative treatment, and Aldrich Killian,
        rejecting an offer to work for Killian's Advanced Idea Mechanics.</p>

      <h2>Becoming Iron Man</h3>
        <p>In 2010, Stark travels to war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison Lieutenant Colonel James
          Rhodes to demonstrate Stark's new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark
          is critically wounded and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings. Fellow captive Ho Yinsen, a doctor,
          implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep shrapnel shards from reaching his heart and killing him.
          Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's
          electromagnet and a suit of powered armor. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop, Yinsen sacrifices himself
          to
          divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying
          Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert. Rescued by Rhodes,
          Stark returns home to announce that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. In his home workshop,
          Stark
          builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor.
          Stark learns that Obadiah Stane has been engaged in arms trafficking to criminals worldwide, and is staging a
          coup to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark, in his new armor, flies to Afghanistan and saves the
          villagers. Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the arc reactor from his chest, revealing that Stane was
          responsible for Stark's captivity. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it and defeats
          Stane.
          The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being "Iron Man."

      <h2>Death of Iron Man</h2>
      <p>In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Tony Stark dies in the movie "Avengers: Endgame" (2019).
        In the film, Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man, sacrifices himself to save the universe from the villainous
        Thanos. During the climactic battle, Tony Stark retrieves the Infinity Stones and uses them to wield the power
        necessary to defeat Thanos and his army. However, the immense energy from the Stones takes a toll on Tony's
        body,
        and he succumbs to his injuries shortly after the battle.
        Iron Man's death is a pivotal moment in the MCU and marks the end of Tony Stark's character arc, as he goes from
        a
        self-centered genius to a hero who is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the greater good.
